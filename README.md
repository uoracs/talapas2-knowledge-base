# Talapas Knowledge Base

This is the github repository for the user-facing documentation of UO RACS resaerch computing cluster, Talapas.

## Repo Structure and Contributing

The website is built using the static site generator, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with the [Just-The-Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme. All content on the site is generated from source markdown files (i.e. `.md`) within the repository. The landing page is laid out in `index.md` where the remaining documentation pages live in the `docs/` folder.

To contribute feel free to edit any of the documentation markdown files. Preferrably if the change is significant in size, make the changes in a new feature branch, followed by creating a pull request to merge those changes into the main branch. Only the main branch is deployed to the site through [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) and is automatically deployed on any new changes to the main branch.

For more details on the formmatting of specific details including callouts, code blocks, mermaid diagrams, page linking, etc see the documentation site for the Just-The-Docs theme [here](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) (built with itself!).
