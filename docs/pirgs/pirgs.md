# PIRG: Principal Investigator Research Group

All research and class work on Talapas is organized through Academic or Research Principal Investigator Research Groups (PIRGs). These are linux groups and SLURM accounts constructed to create permission boundaries and for proper storage and compute usage accounting. All users of Talapas need to be a part of **at least one** PIRG. Each PIRG has a "PI" that is the responsible party for all things done by members of the PIRG, including computational work and proper data storage. See the below pages for more details on either Academic or Research PIRGs.
