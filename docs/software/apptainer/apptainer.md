# Apptainer

In computing, Apptainer is an open-source container platform designed specifically for high-performance computing (HPC) and scientific workloads. Unlike general-purpose container systems like Docker, Apptainer was built with researchers in mind, enabling them to package their applications, libraries, and dependencies into portable images that can run reproducibly across different environments. This makes it easier to share complex scientific software without worrying about system compatibility. Apptainer integrates well with HPC schedulers and leverages existing user permissions for security, allowing researchers to run containers on large-scale clusters without requiring root access.

Apptainer is available in all users' PATH on Talapas, enabling it without the need to load a module.
