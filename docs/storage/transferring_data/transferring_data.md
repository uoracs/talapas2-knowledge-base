# Transferring Data

Transferring data between Talapas, Research Storage, local machines and cloud providers can all be done in multiple different ways. The preferred method of doing any transferring of data is through Globus. Globus transfers provide you with the fastest network speeds when moving data from or to Talapas/Research storage and operate in a "set it - forget it" manner.
