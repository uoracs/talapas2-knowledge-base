# Globus Connect Personal

Globus Connect Personal (GCP) is an application that lets you turn your own computer — laptop, desktop, or lab workstation — into a Globus endpoint. Then allows you to securely transfer, share, and access files between your personal system and other Globus collections. The GCP runs in the background, handles authentication, and provides restartable transfers as institutional Globus endpoints.

Install GCP:

Step 1. Navigate to the Globus Connect Personal website, https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal

Step 2. Click the 'INSTALL NOW' button associated with the Operating System on your computer.

Step 3. Follow the provided installation steps and configure Globus Connect Personal.
