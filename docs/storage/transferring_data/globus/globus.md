# Globus

Globus is a secure, reliable, and high-performance service for transferring and sharing large research datasets across institutions, computing clusters, and cloud storage systems. It simplifies the process of moving data by handling authentication, encryption, fault tolerance, and automatic retries, ensuring transfers are both fast and dependable. Researchers can benefit from Globusâ€™s ability to move terabytes of data without manual monitoring, resume interrupted transfers, and provide controlled access for collaborators. Globus can be used through the web-based GUI, through a CLI, or python SDK that enable research workflows through scripting.
