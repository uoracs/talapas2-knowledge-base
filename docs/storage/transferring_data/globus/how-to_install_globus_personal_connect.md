# How-To Install Glous Personal Connect

**What is Globus Connect Personal (GCP)?**

GCP allows you to create a Globus collection on your laptop your labâ€™s server. You can then interact with other Globus collections and easily (and reliably) move and share data from your laptop or lab server to other collections such as the University of Oregon - Talapas2 collection.

Install the Globus Connect Personal software:

1. Navigate to [Globus Personal Connect](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal).
2. On the right select download for your platform of choice (the machine type that hosts your lab data, or a workstation/laptop you use). Windows, Mac and Linux are all supported.
3. Install and configure your globus endpoint using the instructions on the download page. You can use your UO credentials at this point.

{: .note }
Globus Personal Connect often does not work when your local machine running it is connected to the UO VPN. Make sure and disconnect from the VPN and retry your transfers if you run into issues.
