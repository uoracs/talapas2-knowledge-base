The Globus web interface is a browser-based portal for managing data transfers and sharing on the Globus platform. It lets you work with research data across storage systems — without needing command-line tools — while handling authentication, endpoints, and transfers for you.

Step 1. Open a web browser and navigate to Globus, [https://app.globus.org](https://app.globus.org)

Step 2. Select the 'University of Oregon' as your organizational login then click 'Continue'.
