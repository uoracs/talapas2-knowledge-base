# AWS S3

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a cloud-based object storage service provided by AWS that allows users to store, manage, and retrieve virtually unlimited amounts of data. Instead of organizing data in a traditional file system, S3 stores objects—each consisting of data, metadata, and a unique identifier—inside “buckets.” It is designed for high durability, scalability, and availability, making it a common choice for backups, data archives, big data analytics, and hosting static content.
